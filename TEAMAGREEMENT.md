  - 3x Temperature sensors  
  - 3x Electrical conductivity sensors (for nutrients)  
  - 1x Water level sensor  
  - 1x Raspberry Pi (WiFi capable)  
  - 1x Ceramic pot  
  - 1x Leafy greens seed packet  
  - 1x Herbs seed packet  
  - 1x PVC pipe  
  - 1x Water pump

  - Build and assemble the automated garden.  
  - Wirelessly connect the automated garden to the centralized hub.  
  - Ensure the automated garden and self-watering pot are detected as "siblings."  

- **Stretch Goals**:  
  - Build and assemble the standalone sensor.  
  - Connect the standalone sensor to the centralized hub.  
  - Build a social media network for gardeners to share insights about microclimates.
